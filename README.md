**Project Name:** SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

In this capstone project, our goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. We gathered the dataset from the Falcon 9 Wikipedia page and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean the data and gain insights into the factors contributing to mission success or failure. We applied various classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the Decision Tree algorithm yielding the best results.
